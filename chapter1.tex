\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:Motivation}
I want to develop methodology that can be used both by applied researchers and clinicians. 
I want it to be easy enough to describe to someone with a limited statistical background, 
but meaningful and valid so that the results obtained can be used in publication. 
The desire to have it this way stems from working on a project with both statisticians and clinicians.

\label{ch:Intro}
Missing data is a major problem in both applied and theoretical statistics, however, 
it has not received attention proportional to its need. Survival analysis is a well studied field, 
but is relatively complete, so not much new research comes out of this field. 
Propensity score analysis will help us determine causal relationships when we don’t have a completely
randomized experiment. As one could imagine, all three of these fields are important to the applied statistician,
as they will come across at least one at some point in their career.  
I will explain each of these three disciplines in detail before we dive into combining them.
