%\section{HER2 and Cancer Drugs}
!!This section will need major overhaul once I finalize what analyses will be done in the paper. I am for this section to be a very high level overview of cancer and cancer dugs. The sources for this are in my office, and I will need to import them soon.!!

Cancer is a disease in humans where cells in the body begin to grow in an uncontrolled manner (source here!). There are many different types of cancers for the many different types of tissues we have. This paper focuses on breast cancer.

Breast cancer is a common type of cancer with many different subclassifications, that affects both men and women, although women much more. It can be inherited, but often can be detected early on with screening and self-examination. One of the major risks of breast cancer is that it will metastasize, or move from the breast to another area of the body. It should be noted that when a cancer metastasizes to another part of the body, the patient is said to have the original cancer metastized to a new area, not a new cancer. For example, we study breast cancer patients who have metastases to the brain, not brain cancer patients. The reason for this is because the makeup of the cancer cell is the same type of tissue as the original location, not the new one.

Luckily, there are lots of different types of treatments for breast cancer and its metastases. There have been many books and articles written about these, and for more information, you can check out

\begin{itemize}
\item Chemotherapy is a class of drugs given to cancer patients. These types of drugs target fast growing cells (like cancer) and kill them. Capecitabine is a common chemotherapeutic drug
\item HER2 directed therapy: HER2 is a human protein that is associated with cell growth. If it is determined that the patient has the HER2 protein, then HER2 directed therapies can be used. Common HER2 directed therapies include Lapatinib and Trastuzumab, which we discuss in this paper.
\item radiation therapy: When the cancer tumor is radiated by precisely located beams in hopes of killing or disturbing the cancer growth process
\item Surgery: A doctor goes in and physically removes the cancerous cells.
\item Hormone therapy: Some cancers have hormone receptors in the tumor cells. If this is the case, then drugs that interfere with these receptors can be used
\end{itemize}
Often times, a combination of these treatments is used. The exact course of treatment is very dependent on the type of cancer and the type of person. For example, chemotherapy is very difficult on the body, so it is not often used on the very elderly and frail. The course of treatment given should be determined by a subject matter expert (the oncologist), and is highly individual and cancer dependent.
