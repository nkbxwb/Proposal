\chapter{Conclusion}
This paper details how to use multiply imputed data to answer survival analysis and causal analysis questions. The motivating example was cancer data, and the methods are tailored towards that. Along the way, we discover new visualization and pooling tools to aid in analysis of multiply imputed data. We test the methods out on a large cancer dataset, trying to draw meaningful inference from a dataset with substantial missingness.
