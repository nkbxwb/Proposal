\chapter{Conclusion}
This paper details how to use multiply imputed data to answer survival analysis questions. The motivation for the methods used is cancer data, although sufficient detail is given so that the methods can be applied towards other areas. Along the way, we analyze and visualize the results, and discuss alternative methods of use. We test the methods out on a large cancer dataset, trying to draw meaningful inference from a dataset with substantial missingness.
