\chapter{Conclusion}
This paper details how to use multiply imputed data to answer survival and causal analysis questions. The motivation for the methods used is cancer data, although sufficient detail is given so that the methods can be applied towards other areas. The first section gives background information. In the second, we discuss the methods and theory used as well as alternative methods of use. In the third section, we test the methods out on a large cancer dataset, trying to draw meaningful inference from a dataset with substantial missingness.
