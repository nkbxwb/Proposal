abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chained equations imputation is widely used in medical research. It uses a set of conditional models, so is more flexible than joint modelling imputation for the imputation of different types of variables (e.g. binary, ordinal or unordered categorical). However, chained equations imputation does not correspond to drawing from a joint distribution when the conditional models are incompatible. Concurrently with our work, other authors have shown the equivalence of the two imputation methods in finite samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Taking a different approach, we prove, in finite samples, sufficient conditions for chained equations and joint modelling to yield imputations from the same predictive distribution. Further, we apply this proof in four specific cases and conduct a simulation study which explores the consequences when the conditional models are compatible but the conditions otherwise are not satisfied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We provide an additional "non-informative margins" condition which, together with compatibility, is sufficient. We show that the non-informative margins condition is not satisfied, despite compatible conditional models, in a situation as simple as two continuous variables and one binary variable. Our simulation study demonstrates that as a consequence of this violation order effects can occur; that is, systematic differences depending upon the ordering of the variables in the chained equations algorithm. However, the order effects appear to be small, especially when associations between variables are weak.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Since chained equations is typically used in medical research for datasets with different types of variables, researchers must be aware that order effects are likely to be ubiquitous, but our results suggest they may be small enough to be negligible.},

abstract = {Missing data form a problem in every scientific discipline, yet the techniques required to handle them are complicated and often lacking. One of the great ideas in statistical science—multiple imputation—fills gaps in the data with plausible values, the uncertainty of which is coded in the data itself. It also solves other problems, many of which are missing data problems in disguise. Flexible Imputation of Missing Data is supported by many examples using real data taken from the author's vast experience of collaborative research, and presents a practical guide for handling missing data under the framework of multiple imputation. Furthermore, detailed guidance of implementation in R using the author’s package \{MICE\} is included throughout the book. Assuming familiarity with basic statistical concepts and multivariate methods, Flexible Imputation of Missing Data is intended for two audiences: (Bio)statisticians, epidemiologists, and methodologists in the social and health sciences Substantive researchers who do not call themselves statisticians, but who possess the necessary skills to understand the principles and to follow the recipes This graduate-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by a verbal statement that explains the formula in layperson terms. Readers less concerned with the theoretical underpinnings will be able to pick up the general idea, and technical material is available for those who desire deeper understanding. The analyses can be replicated in R using a dedicated package developed by the author.},

@article{Lee2010a,
abstract = {Statistical analysis in epidemiologic studies is often hindered by missing data, and multiple imputation is increasingly being used to handle this problem. In a simulation study, the authors compared 2 methods for imputation that are widely available in standard software: fully conditional specification (FCS) or "chained equations" and multivariate normal imputation (MVNI). The authors created data sets of 1,000 observations to simulate a cohort study, and missing data were induced under 3 missing-data mechanisms. Imputations were performed using FCS (Royston's "ice") and MVNI (Schafer's NORM) in Stata (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas), with transformations or prediction matching being used to manage nonnormality in the continuous variables. Inferences for a set of regression parameters were compared between these approaches and a complete-case analysis. As expected, both FCS and MVNI were generally less biased than complete-case analysis, and both produced similar results despite the presence of binary and ordinal variables that clearly did not follow a normal distribution. Ignoring skewness in a continuous covariate led to large biases and poor coverage for the corresponding regression parameter under both approaches, although inferences for other parameters were largely unaffected. These results provide reassurance that similar results can be expected from FCS and MVNI in a standard regression analysis involving variously scaled variables.},

abstract = {In many observational studies, analysts estimate treatment effects using propensity scores, e.g. by matching or sub-classifying on the scores. When some values of the covariates are missing, analysts can use multiple imputation to fill in the missing data, estimate propensity scores based on the m completed datasets, and use the propensity scores to estimate treatment effects. We compare two approaches to implement this process. In the first, the analyst estimates the treatment effect using propensity score matching within each completed data set, and averages the m treatment effect estimates. In the second approach, the analyst averages the m propensity scores for each record across the completed datasets, and performs propensity score matching with these averaged scores to estimate the treatment effect. We compare properties of both methods via simulation studies using artificial and real data. The simulations suggest that the second method has greater potential to produce substantial bias reductions than the first, particularly when the missing values are predictive of treatment assignment.},

abstract = {We consider the relative performance of two common approaches to multiple imputation (MI): joint MI, in which the data are modeled as a sample from a joint distribution; and conditional MI, in which each variable is modeled conditionally on all the others. Implementations of joint MI are typically restricted in two ways: first, the joint distribution of the data is assumed to be multivariate normal, and second, in order to use the multivariate normal distribution, categories of discrete variables are assumed to be probabilistically constructed from continuous values. We use simulations to examine the implications of these assumptions. For each approach, we assess (1) the accuracy of the imputed values, and (2) the accuracy of coefficients and fitted values from a model fit to completed datasets. These simulations consider continuous, binary, ordinal, and unordered-categorical variables. One set of simulations uses multivariate normal data and one set uses data from the 2008 American National Election Study. We implement a less restrictive approach than is typical when evaluating methods using simulations in the missing data literature: in each case, missing values are generated by carefully following the conditions necessary for missingness to be “missing at random” (MAR).We find that in these situations conditional MI is more accurate than joint multivariate normal MI whenever the data include categorical variables.},

abstract = {The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.},

abstract = {The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features, potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.},

abstract = {Multiple imputation by chained equations is a flexible and practical approach to handling missing data. We describe the principles of the method and show how to impute categorical and quantitative variables, including skewed variables. We give guidance on how to specify the imputation model and how many imputations are needed. We describe the practical analysis of multiply imputed data, including model building and model checking. We stress the limitations of the method and discuss the possible pitfalls. We illustrate the ideas using a data set in mental health, giving Stata code fragments.},

@article{Stuart2009a,
abstract = {Multiple imputation is an effective method for dealing with missing data, and it is becoming increasingly common in many fields. However, the method is still relatively rarely used in epidemiology, perhaps in part because relatively few studies have looked at practical questions about how to implement multiple imputation in large data sets used for diverse purposes. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on the practicalities and diagnostics for multiple imputation in large data sets. It primarily discusses the method of multiple imputation by chained equations, which iterates through the data, imputing one variable at a time conditional on the others. Illustrative data were derived from 9,186 youths participating in the national evaluation of the Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program, a US federally funded program designed to develop and enhance community-based systems of care to meet the needs of children with serious emotional disturbances and their families. Multiple imputation was used to ensure that data analysis samples reflect the full population of youth participating in this program. This case study provides an illustration to assist researchers in implementing multiple imputation in their own data.},
