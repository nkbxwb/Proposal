In this thesis, we will unify the theory of multiple imputation, 
survival analysis, and propensity score analysis. 
While each of these fields have been studied on their own intensely, 
there has been little work on using the three in trio. 
Starting out with an incomplete dataset, we aim to impute reasonable imputations, run survival 
analysis on each of the imputed datasets to get survival estimates, and then do propensity score 
analysis to observe causal effects. I apply the methodology to cancer survival in a case study, 
but the methods used are general, and could be used for any type of data.
